This is a repository for the animations of the LSM

The LSM solutions seem to be very independent to the value of R of the measuring antennas, at least as long as the antennas are not inside the target. This can be seen [here](./Phantom/R_sweep/test_slider.html).

On the other hand, when taking into account the regularization parameter $\alpha$, different frequecies are more sensitive at different values. Take a look at these results for the different targets:

 - [two Nylon cylinders](./Nylon-Cyls/alpha_sweep/test_slider.html)

 - [4 in Nylon cylinder](./Nylon-4.0/alpha_sweep/test_slider.html)

 - [Phantom dielectric target](./Phantom/alpha_sweep/test_slider.html)

 - [2 in steel cylinder](./Metal-2.0/alpha_sweep/test_slider.html)
