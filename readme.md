This is a repository for the animations of the LSM

[Here](./alpha_sweep/test_slider.html) we have an animation with respect to the regularization parameter $\alpha$ (move the sliders in order to see something)

[Over here](./R_sweep/test_slider.html) we have an animation against the distance of the antenna from the origin.
